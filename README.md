# PPR Community Repository
### Repository for community-made color schemes/sounds/fonts for [PPR](https://github.com/ppr-game/PPR)

# How to submit
### First of all
Please, make sure that the thing you are trying to submit is fully compatible with the [latest release of the game](https://github.com/ppr-game/PPR/releases).

**Notice:**
As of the latest version (v0.10.3-beta), if you select a sound pack and try to restart the game, it will crash. <br>

To be able to play again, you should either change the sound pack to default before quitting **OR** Change the "audio" value in `config.txt` in game's core folder, to be `Default`

**Please use either .zip or .rar format**

## Submitting
### Please make sure that the title of your submission is not already taken.
1.Clone the repository, I am sure you can find some guides online. <br>
2.Put archive(s) with your submission(s) under the folders, they are all named, the way they are named in the `resources` folder in game's core folder. (Please avoid using the name "Default" in your submission, as it will overwrite the default resources). <br>

```
